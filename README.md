# bootstrap-boilerplate
## Daily Challenge for Mobile Friendly Websites Day 3
This repository is home to my bootstrap boilerplate. This provides a template for future projects.

This project is useful to save time so I don't have to remake this boilerplate for every project. 

### Getting started
Fork this repo to make it your own and edit the boilerplate as you please.
